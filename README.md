Uppmax-specific changes to eigensoft
====================================

Eigensoft code from <https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/alkes-price/software/>, modified in two ways:

1. Find perl using the path
2. Allow for IDs up to 120 characters
3. Allow for up to 1000 populations

The first commit to this repository was the original eigensoft code, so later
commits show the specific changes make to put this in place.  The executables
have also been removed from the `bin/` directory.
